Replaced “ZIP” as fieldname with “Emp_Manufa” as the data that we are using to establish the correct
	proportions for how many labs are randomized into each zip code involves using the manufacturing employment
Added SETX functions on lines 11 and 12 to eliminate the necessity for “point and click buttons"
Added “#” border on lines 8 and 9 to separate sections for setting the path
Added section description on line 10
NOTE: that last three adjustments pushes all lines down by 7 lines
Replaced “G:\MAX-Filer\Research\Labs-kbuzard-S18\CARR\California\Base Data\Labs.shp” with “G:\MAX-Filer\Research\
	Labs-kbuzard-S18\CARR\California\Base Data\GoodLabs.shp” on line 45 to adjust to the further refined list of R&D
	Labs in GoodLabs.shp, as noted in the Journal of Urban Economics article, The agglomeration of American R&D labs,
	by Buzard et al. which sites the use of only 645 labs rather than the 687 labs given in Labs.shp

Began Searching for USA block data file on internet
No 1998 data can be found, 2000 is closest year with sufficient data

7/11/18
Continuing search for USA block data file on internet
Found 2000 census data on https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html under the “Census 2000” tab, yet was unable 
	to download the Census 2000 shapefile; hyperlink leads nowhere
Still working on https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html, located census 2000 block data within the 2007 data tab
	Data only available from this directory on the county level, no country-wide or state-wide data available
Continuing to search for Block data on a state or country level, if not solution may lie in piecing all county block level data 
	together in ArcMap
	
7/12/18
Found State-wide Block Level data for California (and all other states), in Shapefile Format, on https://data2.nhgis.org/main
	after setting the Geographic Levels filter to “BLOCK” and the Years filter to “2000"
Although data doesn’t contain total employment numbers for each block, therefore data which contains each blocks ID number 
	and corresponding total employment numbers must be located and will need to be merged with the California block level data

7/13/18
Located Zip Code Business Data with Manufacturing data for 2000 under the NAICS code starting with 31 on 
	https://census.gov/data/datasets/2000/econ/cbp/2000-cbp.html, located under the file name “Complete Zip Code 
	Industry Detail File"
After researching and looking through multiple sources to resolve whether or not the Census Zip Code data is based 
	off of USPS Zip Codes or dependent on ZCTA data, the Census Zip Code Data seems to be based of USPS Zips and not ZCTA data

7/16/18
Continuing the search for LODES Block Level data with exhibits both the Block ID number and Total Employment data for each block
Found block level LODES data with total emp., manufacturing emp., and block ID in CSV.gz form for California in 2002 (Earliest Form) at 
	https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/lodes/LODES5/ca/wac/ under the name “ca_wac_S000_JT00_2002.csv.gz”
Extracted from gz format using 7-zip File Manager and instructions from https://www.wikihow.com/Extract-a-Gz-File which created an Excel
	version of the File
When opened, X and Y-axes are flipped due to the restricted number of columns in Excel and large amount of blocks in California and 
	unrestricted number of rows

7/17/18
Formatted Column A (w_geocode) to show 0 decimal places, and therefore showing the whole Block ID
Hid Columns C through L to show Total Employment (Column B) next to Manufacturing Employment (Column M)
Hid Columns N through AO as they are irrelevant to the current project
Hid Column M; Manufacturing Employment is unnecessary for current project
Created new excel file named “California WAC.xslx” containing only Column A (w_geocode) and Column B (Total Employment)
Saved file as a CSV file for expected easier use in ArcMap when joining data to “CA_block_2000.shp” in order to have entire state of 
	California’s Block data joined/merged with the total employment for all available blocks
The block IDs in CA_Block_2000.shp contains 15 characters, an additional 0 at the beginning to show CAs State Code as 06 and is in a
	"text" format, one more than in California WAC.csv Blocks ID of which showcases CAs State Code as 6 which is in a "double" format
	whos length is less than the neccesary 15 characters to fit the Blocks FIPS ID
	The double format is a numeric format making it difficult to transform by removing the 0, unlike the text format which is much
	easier to transform and add an additional 0 at the beginning of the FIPS ID
	This forces the need of an additional field in the California WAC.csv which has its Block IDs, with corresponding Total 
		Employment, with a 0 at the beginning so that it matches up with CA_Block_2000.shp Block IDs
ArcMap is unable to add a new field to the data attribute table when associated with a CSV file
Exported the California WAC.xslx as a dbf file using Microsoft Access, in order to add an additional data field in ArcMap, by opening
	California WAC.xslx in Access and right-clicking on the California WAC table and selecting Export and then selecting dBASE File.
	Saved file to the Desktop as a dBASE IV file as CALIFORN.dbf
Imported CALIFORN.dbf data layer along with CA_Block_2000.shp data layer into ArcMap
Opened CALIFORN.dbf data attribute table, selected “Add Field…” option from the “Table Options” drop-down menu. Named field “Block_ID” 
	and changed type to “Text” with Length set to 15. Right-clicked on newly created field and selected “Field Calculator…” from the
	drop-down menu, changed Type to “String”, and entered “0&[W_GEOCODE]” and hit OK. This created the new “Block_ID” field with 
	California.xslx’s Block IDs with a 0 in front of each one, therefore matching up with CA_Block_2000.shp’s Block IDs
To join the two data table together: Open attribute table for CA_Block_2000, select “Join and Relates” and “Join…” from the drop-down
	menu. Choose “STFID” (the Block ID variable in CA_Block_2000) in box 1, choose “Block_ID” in Box 3, select “Keep only matching
	recording” therefore only keeping the 151,188 Blocks of which are available in the California WAC file. Hit OK
Saved Merge data Set as CA_Block_2000_with_Total_EMP.shp in the Base Data Folder: 
	G:\MAX-Filer\Collab\Labs-kbuzard-S18\Admin\CARR\California\Base Data\CA_Block_2000_with_Total_EMP.shp
Working with the K-function Local_3Stage.py python program – entered in
	“G:\MAX-Filer\Collab\Labs-kbuzard-S18\Admin\CARR\California\Base Data\CA_Block_2000_with_Total_EMP.shp” for block data on line
	35. Entered in “C000” and “Block_ID” in first in second spot on line 38 to set the block features. C000 for total employment 
	variable and Block_ID for the Block ID variable
Entered in C000 in line 49 to set the reference measure variable

7/18/18
Ran Program, will run till completion
Working with Zip Code Business Data file, “zbp00detail.txt” to transform into a Shapefile to be used in K-function Local_3Stage.py as 
	the new Zip Code Data File
Imported zbp00detail.txt into Excel using the “From Text” Button within the “Get External Data” drop-down menu, checked the my data 
	has headers box in the Text Import Wizard, changed delimiter to Comma, Clicked Finish
Excel erased the 0s at the beginning of the Zip Codes in Column 1. Formatted all cells in Column A to “Zip Code” format in the 
	“Special” numbers category, which put back in all 0s
Not all data was able to fit on one worksheet due to the newly found amount-of-rows limitation at 1,048,576 rows, troubleshooting
	to get the rest of the data
Researching to figure out why only 151,188 blocks are available in the data set, about ¼ - 1/5 of blocks available in the CA_Block_2000 
	data, perhaps due to the possiblity of only 1/4 - 1/5 of the blocks contain manufacturing employment at the workplace (not 
	residency employment level)
Wrote program in R called: ZIPs_Tot_Emp.r located in G:\MAX-Filer\Collab\Labs-kbuzard-S18\Admin\Complete Zip Code Industry Detail File,
	in order to view and format zbp00detail.txt more efficiently
	Imported the “sqldf” package into R
Formatted by excluding all data of which didn’t have “31----“ (total manufacturing employment, including all naics codes starting with 
	31, 32, and 33); as seen in https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/technical-documentation/reference/naics-descriptions/
	naics.txt) in its naics variable, resulting in the 26586 zip codes with manufacturing data. Confirmed that the "31----" naics
	code covers all 31, 32, and 33 manufacturing naics, by examining zbp00detail.txt file and making sure that for each zip code
	the number of 31, 32, and 33 establishments equals the amount of establishments listed in the "31----" naics code for that 
	specific zip code

7/19/18
Working with Jakes code for transforming the employment bin data in the zip code business patterns data to a total number for 
	manufacturing employment, as the establishments do not have specific employment numbers but are instead separated into buckets 
	such as: 1-4, 5-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-99, 100-249, 250-499, 500-999, 1000+. The program will find the midpoints of each bucket 
	multiply it by the amount of each bucket and adds them together to get the manufa. Employment
	Program is written in SAS and will have to be transformed to be compatible with R
	
7/20/18
Able to rewrite Jake’s code to be compatible with R and create a table which shows the adjusted buckets, zip codes, naics, 
	number of establishments, and total manufa. Employment, saved file as ZIPs_Tot_Emp.R in
	G:\MAX-Filer\Collab\Labs-kbuzard-S18\Admin\Complete Zip Code Industry Detail File folder
Troubleshooting method to export data from R

7/23/18
Exported newly created data table as a dbf file named “ZIP_Codes.dbf” located in the 
	G:\MAX-Filer\Collab\Labs-kbuzard-S18\Admin\Complete Zip Code Industry Detail File folder
Opened “ZIP_Codes.dbf” in ArcMap, realized that a few zip codes were being processed as 4 digit numbers where they should be processed 
	as 5 digit numbers with a 0 at the front. This forces the need for adjustment of “zip” column
Created a new field titled “Zip_Code” as a short integer field (default setting), using the field calculator option I made “Zip_Code” 
	field =[zip], which is the original zip code column. After going into the field’s properties I created a custom format “00000”, 
	which forces the column to have 5 characters and fills any spots with 0s, using the Custom function

Found CRSs for GoodLabs.shp, ZIPS.shp, and CA_Block_2000_with_Total_EMP.shp files. The CA_Block_2000_with_Total_EMP.shp has is using 
	the USA_Contiguous_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic Coordinate system which is what Tony Smith states he is using for his analysis in
	the documentation file: DOCUMENTATION_OF_BLOCK_ANALYSES file in the G:\MAX-Filer\Collab\Labs-kbuzard-S18\Admin\Materials for 
	Block Level Analysis folder. Yet, both GoodLabs.shp and ZIPS.shp both use the GCS_North_American_1983 Coordinate system. This 
	discrepancy may be cause of error when running K-function Local_3Stage.py python program.

All 3 data sets in K-function Local_3Stage now have the same CRS
First successful run of K-function Local_3Stage.py program for California
The assumption that the Zip Code Business Pattern Data is based off of USPS Zip codes and not ZCTA is confirmed by the statement 
	on the census.gov website (where the data was taken from) which states that “ZIP Codes: ZIP codes are defined at the 
	discretion of the U.S. Postal Service and may change from time to time”. This information can be found at the census business
	patterns documentation website at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/technical-documentation/methodology.html
	
7/31/18
Created easier method of join CA_Block_2000.shp with the Block data that includes total employment without having to use access.
	Did this by creating CA_WAC.csv file in excel (same as above on 7/17/18), then wrote script in R titled CA_WAC_Transformation.R,
	of which imports the csv file as a table titled “Block”, takes away the scientific notation, and then exports the table a dbf 
	file titled “CAL_Blocks” saved in the “G:\MAX-Filer\Collab\Labs-kbuzard-S18\Admin\CARR\California\Base Data” file for use in 
	ArcMap
Imported CAL_Blocks.dbf data layer along with CA_Block_2000.shp data layer into ArcMap
Opened CAL_Blocks.dbf data attribute table, selected “Add Field…” option from the “Table Options” drop-down menu. Named field “Block_ID”
	and changed type to “Text” with Length set to 15. Right-clicked on newly created field and selected “Field Calculator…” from
	the drop-down menu, changed Type to “String”, and entered “0&[W_GEOCODE]” and hit OK. This created the new “Block_ID” field with
	California.xslx’s Block IDs with a 0 in front of each one, therefore matching up with CA_Block_2000.shp’s Block IDs.
